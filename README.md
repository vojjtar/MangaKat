## Funcionality
The app is pretty simple. It has hard-coded HTML search function for each site that searches for images on the site. Then it simply passes a list of images (links to the images) to the download function and downloads them to selected location

## Usage

1. Find a chapter of a manga or comics that you would like to download (from the selected sites in the app) and put it into the text box with the example URL
2. Then select the site in the drop-down list and select your download speed (safe by default)
3. Select a path where the program is gonna create a folder with the images
4. Then you can click download and the program should download selected chapter

5. Optionally, you can visit the sites with the 'take me to the site' button to search for more stuff or click the 'show destination' button to get to the download destination quickly
